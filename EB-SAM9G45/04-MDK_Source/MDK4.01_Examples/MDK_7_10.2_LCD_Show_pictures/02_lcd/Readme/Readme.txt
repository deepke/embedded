Purpose
===========================
This application displays two preloaded images on the board LCD, alternating 
between each image every other second.

Requirements
===========================
This package can be used with all Atmel evaluation kits that have LCD
interface, the package runs at SDRAM or SRAM.

Description
===========================
When launched, this example will start displaying two images alternatively, 
changing between them every two seconds. The images must be loaded in SDRAM 
before the program execution, at offsets 0x100000 and 0x200000, respectively.

The image files must only contain raw RGB data, as no file format conversion 
is done. Two already processed images, named image1_rgb.raw and
image2_rgb.raw, are provided in the project folder. 

Usage
===========================
-# Compile the application. 
-# Using SAM-BA#, enable the SDRAM of the chip and download the two images 
   provided, at offsets 0x100000 and 0x200000, respectively. 
-# Optionally, connect the DBGU port of the evaluation board to the computer 
   and open it in a terminal. Debug information generated by the application 
   will be visibled that way. 
    - Settings: 115200 bauds, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no flow control. 
-# Using SAM-BA#, download the program inside the evaluation board and run. 
-# The two downloaded images should appear alternatively on the LCD. 
   it. In addition, the following message should appear on the DBGU: 
    \code
    -- Basic LCD Project xxx -- 
    -- AT91xxxxxx-xx
    -- Compiled: xxx xx xxxx xx:xx:xx --
    \endcode
